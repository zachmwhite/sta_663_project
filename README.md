# Riemannian Manifold Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

In this project, we develop and implement a Riemmanian Manifold Hamiltonian MonteCarlo sampling mechanism. Specifically, we implement this for Bayesian Logistic Regression. We employ this in two different situation. The first is where we generate independent and correlated covariates and generate bernoulli draws from probabilities generated by the logistic function for a known beta vector. The second situation is a data set generate from the MAGIC gamma telescope. These data are from 2004, and although they are simulated, the idea is to classify whether the telescope observes high energy gamma rays or noise from hadronic showers (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/magic/magic04.names).

Within this project, we also optimize this code.
